Exploring Loneliness in the Digital Era: A Data-Driven Approach Using NLP and Visualization
Welcome to the repository for "Exploring Loneliness in the Digital Era," a research project delving into the paradox of loneliness despite digital connectivity. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project analyzes the extensive BBC Loneliness Experiment dataset to uncover patterns, themes, and insights about loneliness across demographics.

ðŸŒŸ Highlights
- Research Focus: Investigating loneliness using NLP methodologies and creating visually engaging representations of the findings.
- Dataset: Over 55,000 survey responses from the BBC Loneliness Experiment, encompassing diverse demographics.

Key Techniques:
- Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and lemmatization for high-quality NLP analysis.
- Topic Modeling: Implementing LDA and BERTopic for uncovering hidden themes.
- Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost for loneliness prediction.
- Visualizations: Dynamic dashboards, heatmaps, word clouds, and network graphs for intuitive insights.
- Impact: Insights beneficial for mental health professionals, policymakers, and digital platform developers.
